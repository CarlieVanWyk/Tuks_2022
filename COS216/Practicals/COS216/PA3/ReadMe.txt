• how to use your website
	you can use my website and read the articles but you an also sign-up or login. This will allow
	the user some additional functionality. 

• default login details (username and password) for a user you have on your API
	username: Sarrie
	password: bzmOncbYbA6047bc09edf93599e86169ce38824027EV217pL1ep (123Sar#46)

• any functionality not implemented
	~ "The navigation for this entire project should be stored in a single 
	file (header.php) and included in every page."
	~ Task 4 (bonus)
	~I have my own api but I didn't have time to implement actually pulling data from it and 
	putting it into my news pages. 

• explanations for the password requirements, choice of hashing algorithm and generation of API keys
	I used SHA-256 as my password hashing algorithm because it is quite secure because it produces 
	a 256-bit hash. Also, the collision probability is quite low, as opposed to some algorithm like MD-5
	I generated my API key using a fucntion tht generates a random string of alha-numeric characters. 
	This way each user gets a different api key by only calling a function.
